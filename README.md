# BetterHabits
We all have habits we are not proud of. If you are looking to change some
of those habits or maybe want to develop new ones, this is the app for you.
BetterHabits lets you set habits you want to attain. With those habits
comes a set of tasks that will repeat throughout the week to strengthen your new habit.
